<H2>What do we do??</h2>

<p> Our effort to the cause has two main focuses. As a club we set up fundraising events to allow our club members to gather and raise money via percentage
nights and other planned events throughout the semester. Our most successful event thus far is our stand-up show named <i>"Dont Forget to Laugh"</i> hosted each semester. We raise money all
year as club to submit a large donation for the annual "Walk to End Alzheimers." Our previous donation from last year 2018 was over 6000 dollars! As a club we have been increasing our
donations by over 500 dollars a year which is contributing to our gorwing club. The money that is donated to the walk mainly supports care takers and those who are already affected with 
the other portions going towards research. 
As a club we also try to raise community awareness to the cause by coordinating visits to the local memory care unit to hang out and provide activities for the residents.
The club is a simple and very effective way to get involved in cause that effects so many people worldwide. If you are interested in more information you can follow us

<H2>Silver Leaf Memory Care</h2>

<p> At silver leaf we gather as a club and visit the local home in Athens to provide company and activites for the residents and they sure do love us! We have been visiting the 
home for some years now and some of the residents remember and look forwards to our visits. The visits usally last about 1 hour long (4pm-5pm) before the residents eat dinner.
The scene can be overwelming to those who have never visited a memory care unit due to the fact of every resident being at differnet stages of Alzheimers or Dementia, but do
not let that detur you from attending. The time invested is very little but the reward of givng your time to those at the home is well worth it!  </p>
